# Mike's Balls

Mike's Balls is a short, fun and fast-paced rogue-lite game in which players have to kill hordes of enemies by picking balls. These balls orbit around the player and have different and unique effects, such as explosions, lasers and more. Find powerful combinations of balls and try to survive as long as possible. Let me tell you is not that easy task to accomplish.

This game has been solo developed by Pablo Lario in around 2 months, using the Unity Engine and C#. The game currently is in a demo version. In case it has traction I will consider making a full release on Steam, adding a lot of content and polish.

The game has been inspired in Vampire Survivors and similar games, but I tried to gave my own twist to it. This twist are the classes of balls and their oribtting around the player, allowing players to upgrade them and combine them so that they can be come powerful and strong.
